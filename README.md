# No-Spoiler NBA Schedule
 <h2>
Tired of searching for game times but accidentally getting spoiled?</h2>
<p>This is a simple React App to view the NBA schedule without any spoilers for today's games (in your local time), as well as future and past dates.</p>
<p>You can easily view the game status by Clicking 'Show Scores' or get the link directly to watch the game on NBA.com</p>
<p>During live games, the status is behind by a few minutes since the NBA uses a different JSON source for live stats</p>
